## PyPI Package Scanning

malwi can directly scan PyPI packages without executing malicious logic, typically placed in `setup.py` or `__init__.py` files:

```bash
malwi pypi requests
````

## Why malwi?

Malicious actors are increasingly [targeting open-source projects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04991), introducing packages designed to compromise security.

Common malicious behaviors include:

- Data exfiltration: Theft of sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, or user data.
- Backdoors: Unauthorized remote access to systems, enabling attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
- Destructive actions: Deliberate sabotage, including file deletion, database corruption, or application disruption.

## How does it work?

malwi applies [DistilBert](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/distilbert) based on the design of [_Zero Day Malware Detection with Alpha: Fast DBI with Transformer Models for Real World Application_ (2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14886v1). The [malwi-samples](https://github.com/schirrmacher/malwi-samples) dataset is used for training.

### 1. Compile Python files to bytecode

```
def runcommand(value):
    output = subprocess.run(value, shell=True, capture_output=True)
    return [output.stdout, output.stderr]
```

```
  0           RESUME                   0

  1           LOAD_CONST               0 (<code object runcommand at 0x5b4f60ae7540, file "example.py", line 1>)
              MAKE_FUNCTION
              STORE_NAME               0 (runcommand)
              RETURN_CONST             1 (None)
  ...
```

### 2. Map bytecode to tokens

```
TARGETED_FILE resume load_global subprocess load_attr run load_fast value load_const INTEGER load_const INTEGER kw_names capture_output shell call store_fast output load_fast output load_attr stdout load_fast output load_attr stderr build_list return_value
```

### 3. Feed tokens into pre-trained DistilBert

```
=> Maliciousness: 0.92
```

This creates a list with malicious code objects. However malicious code might be split into chunks and spread across
a package. This is why the next layers are needed.

### 4. Take final decision

The DistilBERT model makes the final maliciousness decision based on the token patterns.

```
=> Maliciousness: 0.92
```

## Limitations

The malicious dataset includes some boilerplate functions, such as init functions, which can also appear in benign code. These cause false positives during scans. The goal is to triage and reduce such false positives to improve malwi's accuracy.

## What's next?

The first iteration focuses on **maliciousness of Python source code**.

Future iterations will cover malware scanning for more languages (JavaScript, Rust, Go) and more formats (binaries, logs).

## Development

### Prerequisites

1. **Package Manager**: Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast Python dependency management
2. **Training Data**: Clone [malwi-samples](https://github.com/schirrmacher/malwi-samples) in the parent directory:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   git clone https://github.com/schirrmacher/malwi-samples.git
   cd malwi
   ```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests

# Train a model from scratch (full pipeline)
./cmds/preprocess_and_train_distilbert.sh
```

### Training Pipeline

The training pipeline consists of three stages that can be run together or independently:

#### Complete Pipeline (With Data Download)
```bash
# Downloads benign samples from popular repos → Data preprocessing → Training
./cmds/download_and_preprocess_distilbert.sh  # Downloads training data first
./cmds/train_tokenizer.sh                      # Train tokenizer
./cmds/train_distilbert.sh                     # Train model
```

#### Complete Pipeline (Without Download)
```bash
# Data preprocessing → Tokenizer training → Model training
./cmds/preprocess_and_train_distilbert.sh
```

#### Individual Stages
```bash
# 1. Download benign samples from popular GitHub repositories
uv run python -m src.research.download_data

# 2. Data Preprocessing (parallel by default, ~5-7 min on 8 cores)
./cmds/preprocess_data.sh

# 3. Tokenizer Training (~2 min)
./cmds/train_tokenizer.sh

# 4. Model Training (~5 hours on NVIDIA RTX 4090)
./cmds/train_distilbert.sh
```

### Training Data Sources

The preprocessing script (`preprocess_data.sh`) combines multiple data sources for robust model training:

#### Benign Samples
- `.repo_cache/benign_repos/` - Clean Python repositories (populated by `download_data` from popular GitHub repos)
- `../malwi-samples/python/benign/` - False-positives

#### Malicious Samples
- `../malwi-samples/python/malicious/` - Confirmed malware samples
- `../malwi-samples/python/suspicious/` - Suspicious code patterns, not necessarily malicious (used for future multi-category classification)

### Testing & Quality

```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest tests

# Code formatting
uv run ruff format .

# Linting
uv run ruff check .

# Regenerate test data (after compiler changes)
uv run python util/regenerate_test_data.py
```
